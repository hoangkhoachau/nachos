/* taps.c
 *	Program that helps in solving the tapwater problem in test/tapwater.c.
 *
 *	taps will write which tap distributed water to output.txt.
 *
 * 	NOTE: for some reason, user programs with global data structures
 *	sometimes haven't worked in the Nachos environment.  So be careful
 *	out there!  One option is to allocate data structures as
 * 	automatics within a procedure, but if you do this, you have to
 *	be careful to allocate a big enough stack to hold the automatics!
